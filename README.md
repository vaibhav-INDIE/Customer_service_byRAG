# Email RAG for Enhanced Customer Service: A GPU-Efficient Approach

This repository showcases an innovative approach to revolutionizing customer service using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. By applying this system to email data, we demonstrate how to deliver personalized, efficient, and proactive support, even with limited computational resources.

## The Challenge: Personalized Customer Service Without the GPU Overhead

Traditional deep learning models, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), often demand substantial GPU power for tasks like text embedding and response generation. This poses a significant barrier for many businesses, especially smaller ones, looking to leverage AI for customer service enhancement.

Our project tackles this challenge head-on by demonstrating how to build a powerful RAG system that prioritizes efficiency without compromising accuracy.

## Our Solution: Email RAG with API-Driven Embeddings and Local Response Generation

1. **API-Powered Text Embeddings:**
   - Recognizing the computational demands of embedding large volumes of text, we utilize Google's Text Embedding API. This approach offers several key advantages:
      - **Scalability:**  Handle large customer interaction datasets without the need for powerful GPUs.
      - **Efficiency:**  Benefit from Google's optimized infrastructure for fast and efficient embedding generation.
      - **State-of-the-art Performance:**  Leverage Google's pre-trained models to capture rich semantic meaning from customer emails.

   Here's how we process and embed data, as visualized in our code:

2. **Local Response Generation with Gensim:**
    -  We leverage the `gensim` library for response generation, a powerful and efficient library that excels in similarity search and topic modeling. Key benefits include:
        - **GPU Independence:** Run effectively on standard CPUs, eliminating the reliance on expensive GPU resources. 
        - **Lightweight and Fast:** `gensim` is designed for efficient processing, making it ideal for real-time customer service applications. 

   Our system generates intelligent responses by referencing relevant past interactions, as illustrated below:

##  Adapting Email RAG to Customer Service 

Here's how our existing Email RAG system can be applied to the domain of customer service:

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:**
    - Instead of email data, you would input customer service interactions, such as chat logs, support tickets, or even transcribed phone calls. 
    -  The `complete_interaction` field would combine relevant attributes from these interactions.

2. **Leveraging Existing Embeddings:**
    - The same principle of embedding interactions applies. You would use Google's Text Embedding API to generate embeddings for customer service data.

3. **Query Understanding and Retrieval:** 
    - Incoming customer inquiries would be embedded and compared against the existing interaction embeddings to find the most similar historical cases.

4. **Response Generation:**
    -  This is where our approach differs slightly. Instead of directly using a large language model, you'd employ `gensim` for:
        - **Similarity-Based Retrieval:** Find the most relevant responses from past interactions based on embedding similarity.
        - **Topic Modeling:** Identify common topics and themes within customer inquiries, which can then be used to provide more targeted information or route inquiries to specialized agents.

##  Benefits of Our Approach

* **Cost-Effective:** Reduce operational costs by minimizing hardware requirements.
* **Accessibility:**  Empower businesses of all sizes to leverage advanced AI for customer service.
* **Real-Time Performance:**  Deliver rapid responses to customer inquiries, crucial for a positive service experience. 

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical and effective approach to building a powerful customer service RAG system, even with limited access to GPU resources. By combining API-driven embeddings with local, efficient response generation using `gensim`, we pave the way for wider adoption of AI-powered customer service solutions.
